﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing **n** queens on an **n×n** chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.Given an integer **n**, return **the number** of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.# Example:**Input**:  4**Output**: 2**Explanation**:  There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown below.[ // Solution 1 [".Q..",   "...Q",  "Q...",  "..Q."],// Solution 2 ["..Q.",    "Q...",  "...Q",  ".Q.."]]# solution 1 recursion row, loop col,  try put 1 position, check the queen attacked position, queen should not be put, recursion to the bottom, if all deeper recursion position fullfill the condition, and the position number is the row sum number, then this condition is one of the solution, append it to the result array.# solution 2recursion row, loop col,  try put 1 position, check the queen not attacked position where queen should be put, recursion to the bottom, if all deeper recursion position fullfill the condition, and the position number is the row sum number, then this condition is one of the solution, append it to the result array.# solution 3recursion row, loop col with bit operation.
