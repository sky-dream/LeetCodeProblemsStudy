﻿You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

Initially the number of elements in A and B are m and n respectively.

# Example:
```
Input:
A = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
B = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```
